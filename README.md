# iCheckMovies Next Movie Scraper

This scrapes icheckmovies.com for the next movie on my list to watch. The more ICM toplists a movie is on, the higher it is on my list. We cannot access this without logging in, but the [1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/) is a good proxy for this.

To only get the movies I have not seen myself already I use [this](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/?user=soviel&sort=officialtoplists) url.
